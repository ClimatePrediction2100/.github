# Introduction

Welcome to the Global Climate Prediction Model (GCPM) project! This project is dedicated to developing a cost-efficient neural network-based approach for long-term climate prediction up to the year 2100. Traditional climate prediction models are expensive and often focus on short-term forecasts. Our approach leverages modern machine learning techniques to create an affordable and reliable model for extended climate forecasting.

## Objectives

•	Develop a Cost-Effective Climate Prediction Model: Use neural network models trained on observational data to predict climate changes efficiently.

•	Long-Term Climate Simulation: Provide simulations and predictions for climate conditions up to the year 2100.

•	Enhance Model Reliability and Causality: Integrate temperature and greenhouse gas data to improve the model’s accuracy and causal understanding.

•	Validation: Comparable results with the IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report, indicating the model’s efficacy.

•	Open Source and Community Engagement: The project’s code and results are open-source, and visualization services are available to enhance public awareness of climate change.
